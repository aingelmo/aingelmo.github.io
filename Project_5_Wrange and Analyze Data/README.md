# Project 5: Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Description

In this project, I will analyze the data from [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates "WeRateDogs Twitter"). 

The dataset contains information about @dog_rates tweets (tweet ID, timestamp, text,etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets since August1, 2017. Ratings come in a special format: they almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators are usually are higher than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.

## Procedures

The whole project will be developed in a Jupyter Notebook with the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* requests
* tweepy
* json

The edition of text will be done with Notepad++. In case of needing something more powerful, MS Word will be the tool chosen.
