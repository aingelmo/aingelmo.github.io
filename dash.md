Analyze and compare data between different variables on time. The main chart will scatter the plots between the two selected variables on the dropdown menu divided by country and continent. The sidecharts will show how the variables evolved for the selected country in the time selected. You can group the data by _months_ or _quarter_ and slide the time bar to update the results. If you desire to check the evolution in time of a country for the selected variables, just click on it on the main chart.
